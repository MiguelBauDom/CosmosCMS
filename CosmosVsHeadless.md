# Cosmos - Headless Performance, Simpler to Use

While headless CMSs offer many advantages, they also face some criticisms: complex, not user friendly, high maintence costs, reliance on API's.  Here is how Cosmos addresses each of these:

***One major concern is the increased complexity and technical expertise required to set up and maintain the system, which can be a barrier for non-technical users.***

Cosmos was built to be easy to install, and easy to maintain. Web developers need only general HTML, CSS and JavaScript knowledge to be successful, and non-technical users already have the skills to maintain content if they can use things like MS Word or Google Docs.Administrators with a basic understanding of Microsoft Azure can successfully install and maintain Cosmos.

***Decoupled nature of a headless CMS means that content editors may miss the integrated, user-friendly interfaces found in traditional CMSs, making content management less intuitive.***

Cosmos comes with a collection of very user friendly content editing tools, and has a user-friendly content tools that are intutive, friendly and familiar to use.

***Another criticism is the potential for higher development and maintenance costs, as custom front-end development is often necessary.***

Web developers need only general HTML, CSS and JavaScript knowledge to be successful.  No requirement for React, Angular, .Net or other development experience is necessary.

***Finally, the reliance on APIs for content delivery can introduce performance bottlenecks and security vulnerabilities if not properly managed.***

While Cosmos does have a REST API, it does not rely on it.  So performance and security issues are avoided.
